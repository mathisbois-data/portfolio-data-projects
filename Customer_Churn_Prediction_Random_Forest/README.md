# Customer Churn Prediction - Random Forest Classifier

## Project Objective
Build and evaluate a machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn for a telecom service provider, in order to help the business develop targeted retention strategies.

## Difficulty Level
Basic

## Project Content
- Exploratory data analysis, missing value treatment, and initial insights into customer behavior.
- Data preprocessing (encoding categorical variables), feature selection, model training using Random Forest Classifier, and exporting the model.
- Model evaluation using accuracy, recall, confusion matrix, and feature importance. Saving metrics and plots.
- Interpretation of the model results, key feature analysis, and strategic business recommendations.

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier)
- Pickle (model saving)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Dataset
Dataset: Telco Customer Churn
Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## Highlights
- Identification of the key customer attributes influencing churn behavior
- Clear segmentation of high-risk customer profiles
- Strategic recommendations formulated to reduce churn and increase customer retention
